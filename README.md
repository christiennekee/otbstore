This is my store app called OH The Blood. This site is composed of three pages, a Shop page, Cart page and Add New Item page. On the Shop page the user has the ability to look through the available items for sale and choose to add however many of those items to the cart. Once finished the user can click the cart button in the navbar and view all of the items they've placed in their cart. They are also able to see the subtotal of the combined price of their items. There are also two buttons under the subtotal where the shopper has the option to continue shopping or checkout. The third and final page is accessed by adding "/AddItemForm" to http//localhost4000. On this page, different products can be added to the stores database with mongodb using four item description categories.
